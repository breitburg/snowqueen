# SnowQueen

Current KaiOS development experience is not very good. This project aims to improve it by providing a set of tools and libraries to make development easier. No need for HTML, CSS, JS, or React. Just pure Dart.

## Getting Started

To compile your Dart code to a KaiOS app run:

```console
snowqueen compile kaios2
```

This will create an `app_name.zip` file with your compiled app bundle.
