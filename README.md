# SnowQueen

Current KaiOS development experience is not very good. This project aims to improve it by providing a set of tools and libraries to make development easier. No need for HTML, CSS, JS, or React. Just pure Dart.

## Getting Started

To create your first project run the following command:

```console
snowqueen create my_app
```

This will create a new project in the `my_app` directory. To compile it to a KaiOS app run:

```console
snowqueen compile kaios2
```

This will create a `build` directory with the compiled app.
